# Exercise 1

- **bold** Title: Early postnatal expression data from mouse skeletal muscle stem cells
- **bold** GEO identifier (GSE): GSE65927
- Summary: Satellite cells are the primary source of stem cells for skeletal muscle growth and regeneration. Since adult stem cell maintenance involves a fine balance between intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, we performed genome-wide chronological expression profiling to identify the transcriptomic changes involved during early postnatal growth till acquisition of satellite cell quiescence.

```{r}
require(GEOquery)
gse <- getGEO("GSE65927")
names(gse)
gse[[1]]
esetFromGEO <- gse[[1]]
```
